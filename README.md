# Diabetes_Risk_Management
This is a machine learning based insulin management system for diabetic patients and aims to predict expected insulin recommendations for easy and quick management of disease which helps to prevent further complications which may be as a result of poor management of the condition.
Since diabetes is an incurable disease, we are aiming at getting a better solution on how to prevent and maintain it from reaching a worst point, which maybe hard to manage and handle, resulting into other healthy challenges.
